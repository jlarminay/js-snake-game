# JS Snake Game

This project was created as I was supposed to attend an event to get youth excited about programming. I decided to showoff [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) but it turned out the event didn't have any internet. I decided to quickly create a small JS only version to show the concept.

The event was unfortunatly canceld because of Covid, but I'm still happy with how it turned out.

You can play with the project [here](https://jlarminay.github.io/JS-Snake-Game/).
